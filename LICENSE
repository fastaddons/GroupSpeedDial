What does this mean?
This addon is not an open source. I use some open source tools to build it, but the addon itself is closed source.

Why?
Programming is my hobby, but I'm not a hobby programmer :).
I work on my addons full time, every day, often also on weekends. And I've been doing so for a several years now.
My only income are donations, and as you can see on my Patreon page, I'm not doing so well:

If I want to keep doing this, I need to monetize my work. And since I hate ads, and I'm not willing to sacrifice user privacy by sharing data with a 3rd party, the only option is a "Freemium" model - where basic features are free and premium features are paid.
Sadly, "freemium" doesn't go well with "opensource" since anyone could copy it and release it fully free.
I guess any addon developer would tell you that making a living out of addons development is hard...

Is it safe to use non-open source software?
Of course it is! It's much more important that you trust the author of the addon, not the code you see in GitHub!
Popular addon authors receives many "nice looking" offers to monetize them or to buy them. It's up to the addon author to resist these shady offers!

I'm not going to sell my addons to anyone and I don't plan to retire any time soon as I'm only 34 years young :).
And did you know I'm official "Friend of Addons" at Mozilla? :)
